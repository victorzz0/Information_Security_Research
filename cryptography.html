                <p class="subTopicText">It is the fact that the perceived need of computer users and communication privacy has brought cryptography out of the shadow world of espionage and secrecy with which it has been linked traditionally. At the meantime, the advent of the personal computers (PC) and the micros make the cryptographic option a concern of everyday users.</p>
                <p>Before the modern era, cryptography mainly focused on the confidentiality converting comprehensible messages into an incomprehensible one and back again, rendering it unreadable without secrecy. There are two basic methods of encryption: transposition cipher and substitution cipher. It is kind of art of writing and solving codes (the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 2006). Katz J. and Lindell Y. (2007) claimed that this definition mainly focuses on the problem of secret communication as it specified codes used to ensure the privacy of messages.</p> 
                <p>In the late 20th century, cryptography was enabled as a rigorous subject with the advancement of theory and technology. This subject is well defined as “the scientific study of techniques for securing digital information, transactions and distributed computations.” (Introduction to Modern Cryptography, 2007). More generally, it is one approach to privacy in the computer age (Beckett B., 1998). The modern cryptography can be divided into several areas including symmetric-key cryptography, public-key cryptography, cryptanalysis, cryptosystems and so on.<br><br>Here is a video on the history of cryptography.</p>

                <p class="subTopicText">Presently, the cryptography group led by Professor Jens Groth has been participated in various programmes and projects. Professor Jens Groth is the first to propose the first general non-interactive zero knowledge proofs that are efficient enough to be used in practice. Hs has been awarded a Starting Grant by the European Research Council to fund his work on the cryptographic building block known as "zero-knowledge proofs". Generally, zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party can prove to another party that a given statement is true without giving any additional information. Here is a video showing what exactly zero-knowledge is.</p>

            </div>
                <p>Dr Murdoch is probably the most popular researcher at Information Security group. Recently, he was interviewed about the security of the internet things, by the register on biometric payment cards, by BBC news about the introduction of an app store register in China and so on. Such a high popularity benefited from his great research. His best known and most significant work could be chip and PIN is broken. Also known as EMV, Chip and PIN is the now-standard way to secure payment card transactions in all over the world. He is intending to study new tokenisation schemes such as the one used in Apple Pay, and contactless payment schemes. Besides, he also wants to figure out how to better measure and quantify security.</p>
                <p>Reader Sarah who is the research lead in cryptography group is focusing on security and cryptography currently. She and her collaborators used a symmetric cryptograph instead of asymmetric cryptography by noticing the people who issues you the anonymous credential could be the same as the person who verifies it in many cases. She is now working on two main projects. One concerns the tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets and another one is Transparency and Privacy in Information Economies.</p>

                <h3 class="subHeadingStyle">Impact</h3>
                <p class="subTopicText"></p>
                <p>Cryptography is one of the major research directions in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL), specifically focusing on cryptanalysis and financial cryptography. The members in the group have been cooperated actively with collaborators from other institutions such as Princeton, IBM Thomas J. Watson Centre, Google, University of Michigan and so on. </p><p> UCL provides a world-class research environment, hardware facilities and considerably high teaching level, especially in Department of Computer Science. These scholars at UCL and their results have advanced the theoretical knowledge in the domain of cryptography as well as practical products.  Particularly, the zero-knowledge protocols theory firstly proposed by Professor Jens Groth at UCL has been proved its practical value in the real world and it can be said this theory will soon be our human benefit. </p>
